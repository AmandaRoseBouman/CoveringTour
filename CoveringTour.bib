	abstract = {Several schemes for linear mapping of a multidimensional space have been proposed for various applications such as access methods for spatio-temporal databases and image compression. In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space- lling curve achieves the best clustering 1, 14]. In this paper, we analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space- lling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work 14]. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hyper-surface area of the query region and not on its hyper-volume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given in this paper provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and hence the total access time.},

	abstract = {Space ﬁlling curves (SFCs) are widely used in the design of indexes for spatial and temporal data. Clustering is a key metric for an SFC, that measures how well the curve preserves locality in moving from higher dimensions to a single dimension. We present the onion curve, an SFC whose clustering performance is provably close to optimal for cube and nearcube shaped query sets, irrespective of the side length of the query. We show that in contrast, the clustering performance of the widely used Hilbert curve can be far from optimal, even for cube-shaped queries. Since the clustering performance of an SFC is critical to the efﬁciency of multi-dimensional indexes based on the SFC, the onion curve can deliver improved performance for data structures involving multi-dimensional data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a distributed, guidance and control algorithm for reconﬁguring swarms composed of hundreds to thousands of agents with limited communication and computation capabilities. This algorithm solves both the optimal assignment and collision-free trajectory generation for robotic swarms, in an integrated manner, when given the desired shape of the swarm (without pre-assigned terminal positions). The optimal assignment problem is solved using a distributed auction assignment that can vary the number of target positions in the assignment, and the collision-free trajectories are generated using sequential convex programming. Finally, model predictive control is used to solve the assignment and trajectory generation in real time using a receding horizon. The model predictive control formulation uses current state measurements to resolve for the optimal assignment and trajectory. The implementation of the distributed auction algorithm and sequential convex programming using model predictive control produces the Swarm Assignment and Trajectory Optimization (SATO) algorithm that transfers a swarm of robots or vehicles to a desired shape in a distributed fashion. Once the desired shape is uploaded to the swarm, the algorithm determines where each robot goes and how it should get there in a fuel-efﬁcient, collision-free manner. Results of ﬂight experiments using multiple quadcopters show the effectiveness of the proposed SATO algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new inspection planning algorithm, called Random Inspection Tree Algorithm (RITA). Given a perfect model of a structure, sensor speciﬁcations, robot’s dynamics, and an initial conﬁguration of a robot, RITA computes the optimal inspection trajectory that observes all points on the structure. Many inspection planning algorithms have been proposed, most of them consist of two sequential steps. In the ﬁrst step, they compute a small set of observation points such that each point on the structure is visible. In the second step, they compute the shortest trajectory to visit all observation points at least once. The robot’s kinematic and dynamic constraints are taken into account only in the second step. Thus, when the robot has differential constraints and operates in cluttered environments, the observation points may be difﬁcult or even infeasible to reach. To alleviate this difﬁculty, RITA computes both observation points and the trajectory to visit the observation points simultaneously. RITA uses samplingbased techniques to ﬁnd admissible trajectories with decreasing cost. Simulation results for 2-D environments are promising. Furthermore, we present analysis on the probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality of our algorithm.},

	abstract = {When a mobile agent does not know its position perfectly, incorporating the predicted uncertainty of future position estimates into the planning process can lead to substantially better motion performance. However, planning in the space of probabilistic position estimates, or belief space, can incur a substantial computational cost. In this paper, we show that planning in belief space can be performed efficiently for linear Gaussian systems by using a factored form of the covariance matrix. This factored form allows several prediction and measurement steps to be combined into a single linear transfer function, leading to very efficient posterior belief prediction during planning. We give a belief-space variant of the probabilistic roadmap algorithm called the belief roadmap (BRM) and show that the BRM can compute plans substantially faster than conventional belief space planning. We conclude with performance results for an agent using ultra-wide bandwidth radio beacons to localize and show that we can efficiently generate plans that avoid failures due to loss of accurate position estimation.},

We present an online adaptive distributed controller, based on gradient descent of a Voronoi-based cost function, that generates these closed paths, which the robots can travel for any coverage task, such as environmental mapping or surveillance. The controller uses local information only, and drives the robots to simultaneously identify the regions of interest and shape their paths online to sense these regions. Lyapunov theory is used to show asymptotic convergence of the system based on a Voronoi-based coverage criterion.

Drawing from this discovery, we develop the theoretical and computational foundations leading to a generalized procedure for generating Delaunay Lofts — a new class of scutoid-like shapes. Given two extremal surfaces, both with Delaunay diagrams, Delaunay Lofts are shapes that result from Voronoi tessellation of all intermediate surfaces along the curves joining the vertices of Delaunay diagrams that deﬁnes the extremal tessellations. This, combined with the use of wallpaper symmetries allows for intuitive design of complex space ﬁlling regular and semi-regular tilings in 3D space.},

Frontier Exploration planning (FEP) and Receding Horizon Next-Best-View planning (RH-NBVP) are two different approaches with different strengths and weaknesses. FEP explores a large environment consisting of separate regions with ease, but is slow at reaching full exploration due to moving back and forth between regions. RH-NBVP shows great potential and efﬁciently explores individual regions, but has the disadvantage that it can get stuck in large environments not exploring all regions. In this letter, we present a method that combines both approaches, with FEP as a global exploration planner and RH-NBVP for local exploration.

	abstract = {The need for efﬁcient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental applications, such as the water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes, motivates the use of robotic sensors in order to achieve sufﬁcient spatial coverage. Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths is required in order to maximize the amount of information collected, while respecting the resource constraints. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient approach for near-optimally solving the NP-hard optimization problem of planning such informative paths. In particular, we ﬁrst develop eSIP (efﬁcient Single-robot Informative Path planning), an approximation algorithm for optimizing the path of a single robot. Hereby, we use a Gaussian Process to model the underlying phenomenon, and use the mutual information between the visited locations and remainder of the space to quantify the amount of information collected. We prove that the mutual information collected using paths obtained by using eSIP is close to the information obtained by an optimal solution. We then provide a general technique, sequential allocation, which can be used to extend any single robot planning algorithm, such as eSIP, for the multi-robot problem. This procedure approximately generalizes any guarantees for the single-robot problem to the multi-robot case. We extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several experiments performed in-ﬁeld for two important environmental sensing applications, lake and river monitoring, and simulation experiments performed using several real world sensor network data sets.},

In our algorithm, each robot continually computes its buffered Voronoi cell (BVC) and plans its path within the BVC in a receding horizon fashion. We prove that our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance for robots with single integrator dynamics. We show that our algorithm has computational complexity of O(k), which is the same as that of the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA) algorithm, and is considerably faster than model predictive control (MPC) and sequential convex programming (SCP) based approaches. Moreover, ORCA and MPC-SCP require relative position, velocity, and even other information, to be exchanged over a communication network among the robots. Our algorithm only requires the sensed relative position, and therefore is well suited for on-line implementation as it does not require a communication network, and it works well with noisy relative position sensors. Furthermore, we provide an extension of our algorithm to robots with higher-order dynamics like quadrotors. We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm by comparing it to ORCA in multiple benchmark simulation scenarios, and we present results of over 70 experimental trials using ﬁve quadrotors in a motion capture environment.},

The probability of detecting the desired subject based on UAV sensor information can vary in different search areas due to environment elements like varying vegetation density or lighting conditions, making it likely that the UAV can only partially detect the subject. This adds another dimension of complexity to the already difﬁcult (NP-Hard) problem of ﬁnding an optimal search path. We present a new class of algorithms that account for partial detection in the form of a task difﬁculty map and produce paths that approximate the payoff of optimal solutions. The algorithms use the mode goodness ratio heuristic that uses a Gaussian mixture model to prioritize search subregions. The algorithms search for effective paths through the parameter space at different levels of resolution. We compare the performance of the new algorithms against two published algorithms (Bourgault’s algorithm and LHC-GW-CONV algorithm) in simulated searches with three real search and rescue scenarios, and show that the new algorithms outperform existing algorithms signiﬁcantly and can yield efﬁcient paths that yield payoffs near the optimal.},

Mobile robots have to cooperate to ﬁnd a position around the scene maximizing its coverage. The scene coverage is deﬁned as the observation of the human pose skeleton. It is assumed that the robots can communicate but have no map of the environment. Thus the robots have to simultaneously cover and map the scene and the environment. We consider an incremental approach to master state-space complexity. Robots build an hybrid metric-topological map while evaluating the observation of the human pose skeleton. To this end we propose and evaluate different online optimization strategies exploiting local versus global information. We discuss the difference of the performance and cost.

The characterisation of the unobservable directions is made using the nullspace basis of the stripped observability matrix. This allow us to identify which vehicle motions are required to maximise the number of observable states in the system, which in turn affects accuracy in the estimation process. The analysis is performed by modelling the system in the continuous time domain as piecewise constant.

	abstract = {In the bearings-only tracking context, the source state is only partially observed through nonlinear measurements which are the estimated bearings. For a manoeuvring Markovian source, the source trajectory is estimated by means of classical dynamic: programming. However, the quality of the estimation is stongly dependent of the observer trajectory, thus mixing estimation and control. But. in this context, the separation principle (for estimation and control) does not hold. In fact, the problem consists in controlling a partially observable Markov decision process. Application of this framework to search theory has yet been considered in the literature. However, even if the problem presents strong similarities with an approach used in the optimisation of the search effort for a (Markovian) moving source, it is focused on the estimation of the whole source trajectory instead of its detection ,it the end of the scenario. To compensate th s intrinsic difficulty, the observation is richer. Consequently also, the optimisation problem presents important difficulties, i.e. memory and computation requirements. Thus the authors aim to develop a feasible framework, based on the Smallwood and Sondik approach, capable of handling real problems. To attain this objective, a specific algorithm is developed and the dimension of the bearings-only tracking is drastically reduced. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated on realistic sonar scenarios.},

We consider the case in which a predeﬁned path is given for the robot, and we focus on controlling the robot’s speed along the path. We characterize necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the speed controller of the robot for keeping the accumulation function bounded. We then search among the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a ﬁnite set of basis functions. We develop a linear program to compute the optimal speed controller; that which minimizes the accumulation over the environment. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the controllers.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is fast, automated planning of robotic inspections involving complex 3D structures. A model comprised of discrete geometric primitives is provided as input, and a feasible robot inspection path is produced as output. Our algorithm is intended for tasks in which 2.5D algorithms, which divide an inspection into multiple 2D slices, and segmentation-based approaches, which divide a structure into simpler components, are unsuitable. This degree of 3D complexity has been introduced by the application of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection; protruding structures at the stern (propellers, shafts, and rudders) are positioned in close proximity to one another and to the hull, and clearance is an issue for a mobile robot. A global, sampling-based approach is adopted, in which all the structures are simultaneously considered in planning a path. First, the state space of the robot is discretized by constructing a roadmap of feasible states; construction ceases when each primitive is observed by a speciﬁed number of states. Once a roadmap is produced, the set cover problem and traveling salesman problem are approximated in sequence to build a feasible inspection tour. We analyze the performance of this procedure in solving one of the most complex inspection planning tasks to date, covering the stern of a large naval ship, using an a priori triangle mesh model obtained from real sonar data and comprised of 100,000 primitives. Our algorithm generates paths on a par with dual sampling, with reduced computational effort.},

Only the ﬁrst edge of this branch is executed at every planning step, while repetition of this procedure leads to complete exploration results.

	abstract = {Within this paper a new path planning algorithm for autonomous robotic exploration and inspection is presented. The proposed method plans online in a receding horizon fashion by sampling possible future conﬁgurations in a geometric random tree. The choice of the objective function enables the planning for either the exploration of unknown volume or inspection of a given surface manifold in both known and unknown volume. Application to rotorcraft Micro Aerial Vehicles is presented, although planning for other types of robotic platforms is possible, even in the absence of a boundary value solver and subject to nonholonomic constraints. Furthermore, the method allows the integration of a wide variety of sensor models. The presented analysis of computational complexity and thorough simulations-based evaluation indicate good scaling properties with respect to the scenario complexity. Feasibility and practical applicability are demonstrated in real-life experimental test cases with full on-board computation.},

The design of control laws is based on carefully constructed objective functions and on an assumption that the agents’ dynamic models are nonlinear yet aﬃne in control laws.

We propose an iterative framework incorporating three components to solve this problem. The ﬁrst two components are a local search procedure and a simulated annealing procedure. They explore the solution space and discover a set of routes. The third component recombines the routes to identify high quality solutions. Our computational results indicate that this heuristic outperforms the existing approaches in the literature in average performance by at least 0.41\%. In addition, 35 new best solutions are found.},

With the introduction of COP it becomes possible to model the planning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporal ﬁeld with time-invariant spatial correlations using autonomous mobile robots, in which the robots are range- or time-constrained. Our focus in this paper is QCOP, a quadratic COP instantiation that looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in a node network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility function capturing the said spatial correlation. We solve QCOP using mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable of planning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. In particular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a network with up to 150 nodes. Beside performing extensive simulation studies to verify the algorithm’s correctness and characterize its performance, we also successfully applied QCOP to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i) estimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal ﬁeld, and (ii) estimating the temperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts.},

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) lies at the heart of routing problems. One of the new variants of the TSP is named as TSP with Profits where the traveler must finish its journey within a predetermined time (cost, distance), by optimizing given objective. In this variant of TSP, all cities ought to not to be visited. The Orienteering Problem (OP) is the most studied case of TSP with Profits which comes from an outdoor sport played on mountains. In OP, traveler gets a gain (profit, reward) from the visited node and the objective is to maximize the total gain that the traveler collects during the predetermined time. The OP is also named as selective TSP. In this paper, we present two polynomial size formulations for OP. The performance of our proposed formulations is tested on benchmark instances. We solved the benchmark problems from the literature via CPLEX 12.5 by using the proposed formulations and existing formulation. The computational experiments demonstrate that; (1) both of the new formulations over estimates the existing one; and (2) the proposed formulations are capable of solving all the benchmark instances that were solved by using special heuristics so far.},

A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications.

A single vehicle is available to serve the customers. The objective is to ﬁnd the vehicle route that maximizes the total collected proﬁt in such a way that the duration of the route does not exceed a given threshold. In the COP, customers are grouped in clusters. A proﬁt is associated with each cluster and is gained only if all customers belonging to the cluster are served. We propose two solution approaches for the COP: an exact and a heuristic one. The exact approach is a branch-and-cut while the heuristic approach is a tabu search.

These decompositions have been widely used for path planning between two points, but can be used for mapping and coverage of free spaces. In this paper, we deﬁne exact cellular decompositions where critical points of Morse functions indicate the location of cell boundaries. Morse functions are those whose critical points are non-degenerate. Between critical points, the structure of a space is effectively the same, so simple control strategies to achieve tasks, such as coverage, are feasible within each cell. This allows us to introduce a general framework for coverage tasks because varying the Morse function has the effect of changing the pattern by which a robot covers its free space. In this paper, we give examples of different Morse functions and comment on their corresponding tasks. In a companion paper, we describe the sensor-based algorithm that constructs the decomposition.},

We present results for the cases of cameras lying on a circle containing a polygon (VC-dimension= 2) or lying outside the convex hull of a polygon (VC-dimension= 5).

The proposed method starts by locating a set of static guards on the map of the target area and then builds a graph called Reduced-CDT, a new environment representation method based on the Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT). Multi-Prim’s is used to decompose the graph into a forest of partial spanning trees (PSTs). Each PST is then modiﬁed through a mechanism called Constrained Spanning Tour (CST) to build a cycle which is then assigned to an individual robot. Subsequently, robots start navigating the cycles and consequently cover the whole area. We show that the proposed approach is complete and robust with respect to robot failure.},

	abstract = {We have developed a procedure to help automate trajectory generation for robotic spray painting applications. In spray painting applications, it is essential that the resultant paint deposition on the target surface achieves acceptable uniformity; we term this the uniform coverage problem. To understand the key issues involved in uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are geodesically convex and topologically simple as representatives of realistic automotive surfaces. For a given paint distribution model, our goal is to understand the relationship between the spray gun trajectory and the following output characteristics: deposition uniformity, cycle time, and paint waste. Our planning approach decomposes the coverage trajectory generation problem into three subproblems: 1) selecting a start curve, 2) determining a speed proﬁle along each pass, and 3) selecting the spacing between successive passes. Using concepts such as area magniﬁcation and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem from diﬀerential geometry, as well as standard optimization procedures, we present procedures to solve each subproblem independently from the others. We demonstrate our trajectory planning procedures by approximating real automotive surfaces by simple surfaces in simulation, and ﬁnally evaluate the eﬀectiveness of our algorithms experimentally on real automotive surfaces.},

In this paper, we deﬁne exact cellular decompositions where critical points of Morse functions indicate the location of cell boundaries. Morse functions are those whose critical points are non-degenerate. Between critical points, the structure of a space is effectively the same, so simple control strategies to achieve tasks, such as coverage, are feasible within each cell. This allows us to introduce a general framework for coverage tasks because varying the Morse function has the effect of changing the pattern by which a robot covers its free space. In this paper, we give examples of different Morse functions and comment on their corresponding tasks. In a companion paper, we describe the sensor-based algorithm that constructs the decomposition.},

Visibility constraints on both maximum viewing distance and maximum angle of incidence are considered to better model real sensors.

Experimental results for this algorithm are discussed. Next, the algorithm is extended to three dimensions and inspection paths are shown.},

Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic demining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classiﬁed as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompositions. The ﬁnal section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},

The novelty of this approach lies in the creation of a new method for analyzing openings in front of the robot that highly reduces their number when compared with the Nearness-Diagram Navigation (ND) technique, particularly in complex scenarios. Moreover, the angular width of the chosen (selected) gap with respect to the robot vision is taken into consideration. Consequently, oscillations are alleviated, the computational complexity is reduced and a smoother behavior will be achieved. Our technique adjusts the motion law proposed in the Smooth Nearness-Diagram Navigation (SND) method to generate safer paths for the robot by considering the ratio of threats on its sides and applying stricter deviation against an obstacle as it gets closer to the robot. Hence, the problem of deadlock occurring in narrow corridors, with high threats on one side and low threats on the other, is solved without affecting the smoothness behavior. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the power of the proposed approach.},

For navigation and mapping, the robot has only one sensor, which tracks the directions of depth discontinuities. There are no coordinates, and the robot is given a motion primitive that allows it to move toward discontinuities. The robot is incapable of performing localization or measuring any distances or angles. Nevertheless, when dropped into an unknown planar environment, the robot builds a data structure, called the Gap Navigation Tree, which enables it to navigate optimally in terms of Euclidean distance traveled. In a sense, the robot is able to learn the critical information contained in the classical shortest-path roadmap, although surprisingly it is unable to extract metric information. We prove these results for the case of a point robot placed into a simply connected, piecewise-analytic planar environment. The case of multiply connected environments is also addressed, in which it is shown that further sensing assumptions are needed. Due to the limited sensor given to the robot, globally optimal navigation is impossible; however, our approach achieves locally optimal (within a homotopy class) navigation, which is the best that is theoretically possible under this robot model.},

The guiding philosophy of this work is to avoid traditional problems such as complete map building and exact localization by constructing a minimal representation based entirely on critical events in online sensor measurements made by the robot. The data structure is introduced from an information space perspective, in which the information used among the diﬀerent visibility-based tasks is essentially the same, and it is up to the robot strategy to use it accordingly for the completion of the particular task. This is done through a simple sensor abstraction that reports the discontinuities in depth information of the environment from the robot’s perspective (gaps), and without any kind of geometric measurements.

Therefore, we adopt a dynamic data structure called Gap Navigation Trees (GNT), which keeps track of the depth discontinuities (gaps) of the local environment. It is incrementally constructed as the robot which navigates the environment. Upon exploring the whole environment, the resulting final data structure exemplifies the roadmap required for further processing. To avoid infinite cycles, we propose to use landmarks. Similar to traditional roadmap techniques, the resulting algorithm can serve key applications such as exploration and target finding. The simulation results endorse this conclusion. However, our solution is cost effective, when compared to traditional roadmap systems, which makes it more attractive to use in some applications such as search and rescue in hazardous environments.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an observability-based local path planning and obstacle avoidance technique that utilizes an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate the time-to-collision (TTC) and bearing to obstacles using bearing-only measurements. To ensure that the error covariance matrix computed by an EKF is bounded, the system should be observable. We perform a nonlinear observability analysis to obtain the necessary conditions for complete observability of the system. These conditions are used to explicitly design a path planning algorithm that enhances observability while simultaneously avoiding collisions with obstacles. We analyze the behavior of the path planning algorithm and specially define the environments where the path planning algorithm will guarantee collision-free paths that lead to a goal configuration. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the planning algorithm in solving single and multiple obstacle avoidance problems while improving the estimation accuracy.},

To plan the path of the robot, the algorithm relies on the construction of the set of all complete paths between robot and target taking into account inner and outer visible tangents between robot and circular obstacles. The paths are then used to create a visibility binary tree on top of which an algorithm for shortest path is run. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two simulation scenarios, one of them involving global knowledge of the environment, and the other based on local knowledge of the environment. The performance are compared with three different algorithms for path planning.},

Many existing solutions to this problem guarantee safety by making the conservative assumption that any unknown portion of the map may contain an obstacle, and therefore constrain planned motions to lie entirely within known free space. In this work, we observe that safety constraints may signiﬁcantly limit performance and that faster navigation is possible if the planner reasons about collision with unobserved obstacles probabilistically. Our overall approach is to use machine learning to approximate the expected costs of collision using the current state of the map and the planned trajectory. Our contribution is to demonstrate fast but safe planning using a learned function to predict future collision probabilities.},

Our technique uses O(n5) space and preprocessing in the worst case; within certain limits, we can trade o smoothly between the query time and the preprocessing time and space. In the process of solving this problem, we also devise a data structure for output-sensitive determination of the visibility polygon of a query point inside a polygon P.

We propose an efﬁcient one-pass, multi-level algorithm for the construction the solution on the grid. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of shadow boundaries on the surfaces of the obstacles when the vantage point moves with a given trajectory. In all of these situations, topological changes such as merging and breaking occur in the regions of interest. These are automatically handled by the level set framework proposed here.

It evolves from the visibility graph to the Voronoi diagram as the parameter c grows from 0 to ∞. This diagram can be used for planning natural-looking paths for a robot translating amidst polygonal obstacles in the plane. A natural-looking path is short, smooth, and keeps—where possible—an amount of clearance c from the obstacles. The VV(c)-diagram contains such paths. We also propose an algorithm that is capable of preprocessing a scene of conﬁguration-space polygonal obstacles and constructs a data structure called the VV-complex. The VV-complex can be used to efﬁciently plan motion paths for any start and goal conﬁguration and any clearance value c, without having to explicitly construct the VV(c)-diagram for that c-value. The preprocessing time is O(n2 log n), where n is the total number of obstacle vertices, and the data structure can be queried directly for any c-value by merely performing a Dijkstra search. We have implemented a CGAL-based software package for computing the VV(c)-diagram in an exact manner for a given clearance value and used it to plan natural-looking paths in various applications.},

It is widely believed that the Hilbert space- lling curve achieves the best clustering 1, 14]. In this paper, we analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space- lling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work 14]. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hyper-surface area of the query region and not on its hyper-volume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given in this paper provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and hence the total access time.},

	abstract = {Space-filling curves (SFC, also known as FASS-curves) are a useful tool in scientific computing and other areas of computer science to sequentialize multidimensional grids in a cache-efficient and parallelization-friendly way for storage in an array. Many algorithms, for example grid-based numerical PDE solvers, have to access all neighbor cells of each grid cell during a grid traversal. While the array indices of neighbors can be stored in a cell, they still have to be computed for initialization or when the grid is adaptively refined. A fast neighbor-finding algorithm can thus significantly improve the runtime of computations on multidimensional grids. In this thesis, we show how neighbors on many regular grids ordered by space-filling curves can be found in an average-case time complexity of \$O(1)\$. In general, this assumes that the local orientation (i.e. a variable of a describing grammar) of the SFC inside the grid cell is known in advance, which can be efficiently realized during traversals. Supported SFCs include Hilbert, Peano and Sierpinski curves in arbitrary dimensions. We assume that integer arithmetic operations can be performed in \$O(1)\$, i.e. independent of the size of the integer. We do not deal with the case of adaptively refined grids here. However, it appears that a generalization of the algorithm to suitable adaptive grids is possible. To formulate the neighbor-finding algorithm and prove its correctness and runtime properties, a modeling framework is introduced. This framework extends the idea of vertex-labeling to a description using grammars and matrices. With the sfcpp library, we provide a C++ implementation to render SFCs generated by such models and automatically compute all lookup tables needed for the neighbor-finding algorithm. Furthermore, optimized neighbor-finding implementations for various SFCs are included for which we provide runtime measurements.},

	abstract = {Space ﬁlling curves (SFCs) are widely used in the design of indexes for spatial and temporal data. Clustering is a key metric for an SFC, that measures how well the curve preserves locality in moving from higher dimensions to a single dimension. We present the onion curve, an SFC whose clustering performance is provably close to optimal for cube and nearcube shaped query sets, irrespective of the side length of the query. We show that in contrast, the clustering performance of the widely used Hilbert curve can be far from optimal, even for cube-shaped queries. Since the clustering performance of an SFC is critical to the efﬁciency of multi-dimensional indexes based on the SFC, the onion curve can deliver improved performance for data structures involving multi-dimensional data.},

The curves evolve based on a simulation controlled by spatially varying parameters deﬁned by texture maps. We introduce the graphics community to the fascinating area of maze art and present a model for the automatic generation of organic looking labyrinths and mazes. We also present a framework based on regions and patterns for the interactive artistic control of NPR algorithms, such as ours, that evolve in both space and time. In the context of labyrinths, the framework provides the designer with control over both the path complexity and visual aesthetics as the curves evolve. The resulting labyrinths and mazes range from mathematically simple to intricately complex visual structures. Applications of the resulting curves include NPR, difﬁcult to counterfeit imagery, environmental design and architecture, computer games and 1D parameterization of 2D manifolds.},

	abstract = {A space-filling CurV(l is a way of mapping the multi-dimensional space into the one-dimensional space. It acts like a thread that passes through every cdl clement (or pixel) in the V-dimensional Space so that every C:(lll is visited exactly once. There are numerous kinds of space-filling curves. The difference between such curves is in their way of mapping to the one-dimensional space. Selecting the appropriate curve for any application requires knowledge of the mapping schcme provided by each space-filling curve. A space-filling curve consists of a set of segments. Each segment connects two consecutive multi-ilimensional points. Five different t.ypes of segments are distinguished, namely, .Jump, Contiguity, Reverse, Forward, and Still. A dcscription vector V = (.J,C,R,F,S), where.J, 0, R, P, and 5, arc the percentages of .Jump, Contiguity, Rcvcrse, FOlllJUf"d, and Still segments in the space-filling curve, encapsulates all the properties of a space-filling curve. The knowledgc of {\textbackslash}I facilitates the process of selecting the appropriate space-filling curve for different applications. Closed formulas are developed to compute the description vector {\textbackslash}I for any D-dimensional space and grid size N for different space-filling curves. A comparative study of cliIferent space-filling curV(!S with respect to the description vcctor is conclucted and rcsults are presented and diSCllssed.},

We present a relocalization module for such systems which solves some of the problems encountered by previous monocular SLAM systems—tracking failure, map merging, and loop closure detection. This module extends recent advances in keypoint recognition to determine the camera pose relative to the landmarks within a single frame time of 33 ms. We first show how this module can be used to improve the robustness of these systems. Blur, sudden motion, and occlusion can all cause tracking to fail, leading to a corrupted map. Using the relocalization module, the system can automatically detect and recover from tracking failure while preserving map integrity. Extensive tests show that the system can then reliably generate maps for long sequences even in the presence of frequent tracking failure. We then show that the relocalization module can be used to recognize overlap in maps, i.e., when the camera has returned to a previously mapped area. Having established an overlap, we determine the relative pose of the maps using trajectory alignment so that independent maps can be merged and loop closure events can be recognized. The system combining all of these abilities is able to map larger environments and for significantly longer periods than previous systems.},

The accuracy of the map generated in each agent directly contribute to the accuracy of the global map. An agent equipped with a wider Field of View(FOV) camera, more robust to fast movements in its visual SLAM process. FOV of the camera plays a major role in recent direct semi dense visual SLAM approaches for their tracking and overall map generation. We developed a Distributed SLAM framework, where we use an appearance based method to detect small loop closures to support better map generation in agents with relatively narrow FOV cameras. Furthermore, our distributed framework relieves SLAM agents from detecting loop closures by performing that externally.},

To do so, we present a novel technique of loop closing based on layout model matching; i.e., both model information (topology and geometry of reconstructed models) and image information (photometric features) are used to address a loop-closure detection. The advantages of using the layout-related information in the proposed loopclosing technique are twofold. First, it imposes a metric constraint on the global map consistency and, thus, adjusts the mapping scale drifts. Second, it can reduce matching ambiguity in the context of indoor corridors, where the scene is homogenously textured and extracting sufficient amount of distinguishable point features is a challenging task. To test the impact of the proposed technique on the performance of Layout SLAM, we have performed the experiments on wide-angle videos captured by a handheld camera. This dataset was collected from the indoor corridors of a building at York University. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully detects the instances of loops while producing very limited trajectory errors.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised Learning based monocular visual odometry (VO) has lately drawn signiﬁcant attention for its potential in label-free leaning ability and robustness to camera parameters and environmental variations. However, partially due to the lack of drift correction technique, these methods are still by far less accurate than geometric approaches for largescale odometry estimation. In this paper, we propose to leverage graph optimization and loop closure detection to overcome limitations of unsupervised learning based monocular visual odometry. To this end, we propose a hybrid VO system which combines an unsupervised monocular VO called NeuralBundler with a pose graph optimization back-end. NeuralBundler is a neural network architecture that uses temporal and spatial photometric loss as main supervision and generates a windowed pose graph consists of multi-view 6DoF constraints. We propose a novel pose cycle consistency loss to relieve the tensions in the windowed pose graph, leading to improved performance and robustness. In the back-end, a global pose graph is built from local and loop 6DoF constraints estimated by NeuralBundler, and is optimized over SE(3). Empirical evaluation on the KITTI odometry dataset demonstrates that 1) NeuralBundler achieves state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised monocular VO estimation, and 2) our whole approach can achieve efﬁcient loop closing and show favorable overall translational accuracy compared to established monocular SLAM systems.},

We build a complete SLAM pipeline with camera pose estimation, sliding window optimization, loop closure and relocalisation capabilities that utilizes edges throughout all steps. In our system, we additionally reﬁne the initial depth from the sensor, the camera poses and the camera intrinsics in a sliding window to increase accuracy. Further, we introduce an edge-based veriﬁcation for loop closures that can also be applied for relocalisation. We evaluate RESLAM on wide variety of benchmark datasets that include difﬁcult scenes and camera motions and also present qualitative results.

This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efﬁcient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by ﬁnding the spatial conﬁguration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

Given the allocation, subareas are adjusted by a developed heuristic to satisfy the overlap constraints at the inner borders of the split areas. Finally paths allowing for scanning the areas are generated. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the results of the planner.},

Based on several application examples, for example the estimate that about 2000 road accidents per year in Germany alone involve hazardous goods, we conclude that there is a tremendous need for rescue robots. Unlike other markets for advanced robotics systems like service robots, the rescue robotics domain beneﬁts from the fact that there is a human in the loop, which allows a stepwise transition from dumb teleoperated devices to truly autonomous systems. Current teleoperated devices are already very useful in this domain and they beneﬁt from any bit of autonomy added as human rescue workers are a scarce resource at disaster scenarios and a single operator should ideally supervise a multitude of robots.

Due to an increase of deteriorating bridges according to the report released by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), a more eﬃcient and cost-eﬀective alternative for bridge inspection is required. The goal of this paper was to analyze the eﬀectiveness of drones as supplemental bridge inspection tools. In pursuit of this goal, the selected bridge for inspection was a three-span gluedlaminated timber girder with a composite concrete deck located near the city of Keystone in the state of South Dakota (SD). A drone, a Dà-Jiāng Innovations (DJI) Phantom 4, was utilized for this study. Also, an extensive literature review to gain knowledge on current bridge inspection techniques using drones was conducted. The ﬁndings from the literature review served as the basis for the development of a ﬁve-stage drone-enabled bridge inspection methodology. A ﬁeld inspection utilizing the drone was performed following the stages of the methodology, and the ﬁndings were compared to current historical inspection reports provided by the SD Department of Transportation (SDDOT). Quantiﬁed data using the drone such as a spalled area of 0.18 m2, which is identical to the measurement provided by the SDDOT (0.3 m by 0.6 m), demonstrated the eﬃciency of the drone to inspect the bridge. This study detailed drone-enabled inspection principles and relevant considerations to obtain optimum data acquisition. The ﬁeld investigation of the bridge demonstrated the image quality and damage identiﬁcation capabilities of the drone to perform bridge inspection at a lower cost when compared to traditional methods.},

A scalar measure (herein called the density) of the environment deﬁnes a nonuniform coverage metric of the area. Mobile robots are spatially conﬁgured such that their asymptotic placements in an area maximize the nonuniform coverage metric. Over the last ﬁfteen years, a large body of research work has been conducted in solving the area coverage optimization problem where the focus was mainly on theoretical results followed by mostly numerical simulations. In some cases, the coverage optimization algorithms were validated with experimental results, but the implementation platforms were suitable to speciﬁc homogeneous robot platforms. Here, the emphasis is on the real-time implementation of the authors’ previously published theoretical results on area coverage optimization problems using a team of heterogeneous mobile robots. The robots are heterogeneous in the sense that they have different actuator limits, physical dimensions, and processing capabilities. The modularity of the algorithm stems from the fact that the additional hardware/software architecture is open-source and can be applied to different robots regardless of their internal electromechanical system architectures. The algorithm is implemented using the emerging robot operating system in a multithreaded manner. A commercial robot simulator was used to validate the coverage performance followed by a set of experiments conducted in an indoor environment.},

	abstract = {This article examines the coordination problem of the nodes’ motion in a heterogeneous anisotropic mobile sensor network for area coverage purposes. The mobile agents are assumed to have non–uniform with varying scaling sensing ability around themselves. The nodes’ sensor footprint is allowed to be any arbitrary compact planar set, while the coordination scheme accounts for rotation of the latter. The domain sensed by the swarm is partitioned via the proposed distributed scheme that differentiates for standard Voronoi–alike distance–based metrics. The distributed cooperative scheme developed manages to lead the group towards an area–optimal conﬁguration via proper control of the movement and rotation of each sensing node. Numerical results are provided in order to indicate the efﬁciency of the proposed technique.},

In particular, by encoding the different capabilities as different density functions in the locational cost, the result is a heterogeneous coverage control problem where the different density functions serve as a way of both abstracting and encapsulating different sensing capabilities. However, different density functions imply that mass is not conserved as the agents move and, as a result, the normal cancellations that occur across boundaries between regions of dominance in the homogeneous case no longer take place when computing the gradient of the locational cost. As a result, new terms are needed if the robots are to execute a descent ﬂow in order to minimize the locational cost, and we show how these additional terms can be formulated as boundarydisagreement terms that are added to the standard Lloyd’s algorithm. The results are implemented on real robotic platforms for a number of different use cases.},

Given the allocation, subareas are adjusted by a developed heuristic to satisfy the overlap constraints at the inner borders of the split areas. Finally paths allowing for scanning the areas are generated. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the results of the planner.},

Applications vary from exploration of the Mars surface to the urban search and rescue (USAR) domain, where neither a map, nor a Global Positioning System (GPS) are available. We propose two algorithms for solving the 2D coverage problem using multiple mobile robots. The basic premise of both algorithms is that local dispersion is a natural way to achieve global coverage. Thus, both algorithms are based on local, mutually dispersive interaction between robots when they are within sensing range of each other. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms solve the problem to within 5-7\% of the (manually generated) optimal solutions. We show that the nature of the interaction needed between robots is very simple; indeed anonymous interaction slightly outperforms a more complicated local technique based on ephemeral identification.},

Then the binary log-linear learning is adopted to perform motion control, which guarantees optimal coverage. Then a consensus based fusion algorithm is introduced to construct the probability map to guide the following coordinated motion. Finally, simulations are performed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

The algorithm optimizes the on-line assignment of robots to targets, keeps the robots working in separate areas and efficiently reduces the variance of average waiting time on those areas. The latter ensures that the different areas of the workspace are explored at a similar speed, thus avoiding that some areas are explored much later than others, something desirable for many exploration applications, such as search \& rescue. The algorithm leads to the lowest variance of regional waiting time (WTV) and the lowest variance of regional exploration percentages (EPV).

In order to maximize the joint detection probability of random events in a given mission space, we build upon a previously developed distributed gradient-based coverage control scheme to include three additional capabilities: allowing polygonal obstacles, including limited sensing ﬁeld-of-view constraints, and preserving network connectivity through a provably correct algorithm using each node’s routing information. In order to combine coverage and data collection, we formulate and solve a modiﬁed optimization problem with these two objectives.

For each vehicle, an individual state of awareness is deﬁned. The individual vehicle’s state of awareness continuously evolves based on the vehicle’s motion and is updated at discrete instants whenever the vehicle establishes a new rangebased communication link with other vehicles. This information sharing update step aides in reducing the amount of redundant coverage. In this paper we ﬁrst consider the simplifying assumption where no awareness loss occurs when no sensors are monitoring portions of the domain. This scenario is applicable to some search and rescue/retrieval problems (especially with static victims or objects of interests), domain monitoring, and low level surveillance. Under this assumption, a decentralized control strategy is proposed that guarantees that every point within the task domain will be covered with a satisfactory state of awareness even under intermittent communications and/or faulty sensors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel awareness model and decentralized control law via numerical simulations.},

When there is no constraint on the period, the least number of mobile sensors that are needed for the persistent awareness coverage task is derived. Given a network of mobile sensors and a finite period, it is shown that the persistent awareness coverage task can be accomplished if there exists a solution to a set of linear inequalities.

In this paper we generalize the control law based on minimization of the coverage functional to such non-Euclidean spaces punctured by obstacles. We also propose a practical discrete implementation based on standard graph search-based algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm by solving efﬁcient coverage problems on a sphere and a torus with obstacles, and exploration problems in non-convex indoor environments.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the pursuit of a maneuvering target by a group of pursuers distributed in the plane. This pursuit problem is solved by associating it with a Voronoi-like partitioning problem that characterizes the set of initial positions from which the target can be intercepted by a given pursuer faster than any other pursuer from the same group. In the formulation of this partitioning problem, the target does not necessarily travel along prescribed trajectories, as it is typically assumed in the literature, but, instead, it can apply an “evading” strategy in an eﬀort to delay or, if possible, escape capture. We characterize an approximate solution to this problem by associating it with a standard Voronoi partitioning problem. Subsequently, we propose a relay pursuit strategy, that is, a special group pursuit scheme such that, at each instant of time, only one pursuer is assigned the task of capturing the maneuvering target. During the course of the relay pursuit, the pursuertarget assignment changes dynamically with time based on the (time varying) proximity relations between the pursuers and the target. This proximity information is encoded in the solution of the Voronoi-like partitioning problem. Simulation results are presented to highlight the theoretical developments.},

Unlike previous work that uses a simple gradient descent algorithm, here we employ an existing deterministic annealing (DA) technique to achieve more optimal convergence values. We replicate the results of the classical DA algorithm while imposing a limited-range constraint to sensors. As the temperature is decreased, phase changes lead to a regrouping of agents, which is decided through a distributed task allocation algorithm. While simple gradient descent algorithms are heavily dependent on initial conditions, annealing techniques are generally less prone to this phenomena. The results of our simulations conﬁrm this fact, as we show in the manuscript.},

The UAVs are assumed to be equipped with visual sensors constrained by a maximum sensing range and the prior knowledge on the environment is considered to be very sparse. To solve this problem online, derivative-free measurement-based optimization algorithms can be adopted, even though they are strongly limited by local optimality. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the partial initial knowledge on the environment to ﬁnd suitable initial conﬁgurations from which the agents start the local optimization. In particular, a constrained centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a coarse approximation of the surface to cover is proposed. The behavior of the agent is so based on a two-step optimization approach, where a stochastic optimization algorithm based on the on-line acquired information follows the geometrical-based initialization. The algorithm performance is evaluated in simulation and in particular the improvement on the solution brought by the Voronoi tessellation with respect to diﬀerent initializations is analyzed.},

The algorithms use the same planar cellbased decomposition as the Boustrophedon single robot coverage algorithm, but provide extensions to handle how robots cover a single cell, and how robots are allocated among cells. Speciﬁcally, for the coverage task our choice of multi-robot policy strongly depends on the type of communication that exists between the robots. When the robots operate under the line-of-sight communication restriction, keeping them as a team helps to minimize repeat coverage. When communication between the robots is available without any restrictions, the robots are initially distributed through space, and each one is allocated a virtually-bounded area to cover. A greedy auction mechanism is used for task/cell allocation among the robots. Experimental results from different simulated and real environments that illustrate our approach for different communication conditions are presented.},

	abstract = {Search and rescue robots can benefit from small size as it facilitates access to voids and movement in cramped quarters. Yet, small robots cannot be the entire answer for urban search and rescue because small size limits the size of actuators, sensor payloads, computational capacity and battery capacity. Nonetheless, we are attempting to alleviate these limitations by developing the hardware and software infrastructure for heterogeneous, wireless sensor/actuator/control networks that is well-suited to miniature search and rescue robots, as well as a host of other relevant applications. These networks of application-specific sensors, actuators and intelligence will be assembled from a backbone that includes scalable computing, a flexible I/O bus, and multi-hop data networking. But two things will ultimately give our wireless infrastructure its novelty: a dual-baseband communications layer and the embedded virtual machine. The dual-baseband communications layer augments the standard data communication layer with a secondary, sub-millisecond synchronization layer to permit high-fidelity, deterministic, distributed control across the network. The determinism of this dual-baseband communications layer, in turn, enables the creation of the embedded virtual machine, which is a programming construct that abstracts away the physical sensor/actuator/control nodes. With this infrastructure, programming will not be done at the node level, as in conventional wireless sensor networks. Instead, programming will be done at the task level with port-based objects distributed across physical resources as necessary at either compile-time or run-time. At compile-time, the system can assist in the specification of the physical network, while at run-time the system can react to changes in configuration, such as nodes exhausting their batteries or losing connectivity. This paper describes progress todate on developing this scalable infrastructure, specifically the RecoNode high-performance, dynamicallyreconfigurable computational node for the Terminator- Bot crawling robot and the FireFly mid-performance node, as well as their real-time software.},

	abstract = {We address the controller design and the trajectory generation for a quadrotor maneuvering in three dimensions in a tightly constrained setting typical of indoor environments. In such settings, it is necessary to allow for signiﬁcant excursions of the attitude from the hover state and small angle approximations cannot be justiﬁed for the roll and pitch. We develop an algorithm that enables the real-time generation of optimal trajectories through a sequence of 3-D positions and yaw angles, while ensuring safe passage through speciﬁed corridors and satisfying constraints on velocities, accelerations and inputs. A nonlinear controller ensures the faithful tracking of these trajectories. Experimental results illustrate the application of the method to fast motion (5-10 body lengths/second) in three-dimensional slalom courses.},

	abstract = {The Orienteering Problem (OP) has received a lot of attention in the past few decades. The OP is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team OP, the (Team) OP with Time Windows and the Time Dependent OP. Recently, a number of new variants of the OP was introduced, such as the Stochastic OP, the Generalized OP, the Arc OP, the Multi-agent OP, the Clustered OP and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the OP, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the OP has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the OP, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

The prior probability provides a heuristic for MCTS, and the MCTS output is an improved probability for selecting the successive vertex, as it is the feedback information by fusing the prior with the scouting procedure. Experimental results on TSP up to 100 nodes demonstrate that the proposed method obtains shorter tours than other learning-based methods.},

	abstract = {Learning to walk over a graph towards a target node for a given query and a source node is an important problem in applications such as knowledge base completion (KBC). It can be formulated as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a known state transition model. To overcome the challenge of sparse rewards, we develop a graph-walking agent called M-Walk, which consists of a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The RNN encodes the state (i.e., history of the walked path) and maps it separately to a policy and Q-values. In order to effectively train the agent from sparse rewards, we combine MCTS with the neural policy to generate trajectories yielding more positive rewards. From these trajectories, the network is improved in an off-policy manner using Q-learning, which modiﬁes the RNN policy via parameter sharing. Our proposed RL algorithm repeatedly applies this policy-improvement step to learn the model. At test time, MCTS is combined with the neural policy to predict the target node. Experimental results on several graph-walking benchmarks show that M-Walk is able to learn better policies than other RL-based methods, which are mainly based on policy gradients. M-Walk also outperforms traditional KBC baselines.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work is fast, automated planning of robotic inspections involving complex 3D structures. A model comprised of discrete geometric primitives is provided as input, and a feasible robot inspection path is produced as output. Our algorithm is intended for tasks in which 2.5D algorithms, which divide an inspection into multiple 2D slices, and segmentation-based approaches, which divide a structure into simpler components, are unsuitable. This degree of 3D complexity has been introduced by the application of autonomous in-water ship hull inspection; protruding structures at the stern (propellers, shafts, and rudders) are positioned in close proximity to one another and to the hull, and clearance is an issue for a mobile robot. A global, sampling-based approach is adopted, in which all the structures are simultaneously considered in planning a path. First, the state space of the robot is discretized by constructing a roadmap of feasible states; construction ceases when each primitive is observed by a speciﬁed number of states. Once a roadmap is produced, the set cover problem and traveling salesman problem are approximated in sequence to build a feasible inspection tour. We analyze the performance of this procedure in solving one of the most complex inspection planning tasks to date, covering the stern of a large naval ship, using an a priori triangle mesh model obtained from real sonar data and comprised of 100,000 primitives. Our algorithm generates paths on a par with dual sampling, with reduced computational effort.},

This NP-hard optimization problem has recently received increasing attention in several technical ﬁelds such as robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles, or utility management. In this paper, the problem is formulated as a nonconvex Mixed-Integer NonLinear Program (MINLP) having the property that ﬁxing all the integer variables to any integer values yields a convex nonlinear program. This property is used to modify the global MINLP optimizer Couenne, improving by orders of magnitude its performance and allowing the exact solution of instances large enough to be useful in applications. Computational results are presented where neighborhoods are either polyhedra or ellipsoids in R2 or R3 and with the Euclidean norm as distance metric.},

	abstract = {AND CONCLUSIONS THE PRIMARY purpose of this paper has been to introduce and mathematically formulate the covering salesman problem (CSP). The CSP may be stated as follows: Identify the minimum cost tour of a subset of n given cities such that every city not on the tour is within some predetermined covering distance standard, 5, of a city that is on the tour. The CSP may be viewed as a generalization of tbe traveling salesman problem if S {\textless} Min,, {\textbackslash}d,j{\textbackslash} for all \{\vphantom{\}}i, j) G N, as the CSP reduces to a TSP in such problems. Many potential applications of the CSP exist. For example, in designing a collection/delivery route for a bimodal distribution system such as overnight mail delivery, some cities on the network will be served directly by a primary mode, say air, while other cities will be served by a secondary mode, say trucks, whicb originate at their nearest city on the primary route. In such an example, the predetermined covering distance, .S, would be defmed by the maximum distance or time that the goods can spend on the secondary mode.},

We also extend our results to a case in which the convex polygons are arbitrarily intersecting and the subpath between any two consecutive polygons is constrained to lie within a simply connected region; the algorithm uses O(nk2 log n) time. Our methods are simple and allow shortest path queries from s to a query point t to be answered in time O(k log n + m), where m is the combinatorial path length.

In this paper, a novel neural network approach is proposed for complete coverage path planning with obstacle avoidance of cleaning robots in nonstationary environments. The dynamics of each neuron in the topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation derived from Hodgkin and Huxley’s (1952) membrane equation. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. The robot path is autonomously generated from the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network and the previous robot location. The proposed model algorithm is computationally simple. Simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of planning collision-free complete coverage robot paths.},

Here, we consider the case of exterior visibility, where the cameras lie on a constrained area outside the polygon and have to observe the entire boundary. We present results for the cases of cameras lying on a circle containing a polygon (VC-dimension= 2) or lying outside the convex hull of a polygon (VC-dimension= 5). The main result of this paper concerns the 3D case: We prove that the VC-dimension is unbounded if the cameras lie on a sphere containing the polyhedron, hence the term exterior visibility.},

	abstract = {Recent papers on approximation algorithms for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) have given a new variant on the well-known Christoﬁdes’ algorithm for the TSP, called the Bestof-Many Christoﬁdes’ algorithm. The algorithm involves sampling a spanning tree from the solution the standard LP relaxation of the TSP, subject to the condition that each edge is sampled with probability at most its value in the LP relaxation. One then runs Christoﬁdes’ algorithm on the tree by computing a minimum-cost matching on the odd-degree vertices in the tree, and shortcutting the resulting Eulerian graph to a tour. In this paper we perform an experimental evaluation of the Best-of-Many Christoﬁdes’ algorithm to see if there are empirical reasons to believe its performance is better than that of Christoﬁdes’ algorithm. Furthermore, several diﬀerent sampling schemes have been proposed; we implement several diﬀerent schemes to determine which ones might be the most promising for obtaining improved performance guarantees over that of Christoﬁdes’ algorithm. In our experiments, all of the implemented methods perform signiﬁcantly better than the Christoﬁdes’ algorithm; an algorithm that samples from a maximum entropy distribution over spanning trees seems to be particularly good, though there are others that perform almost as well.},

We achieve this by maintaining an auxiliary graph whose nodes correspond to alternating trees in the Edmonds’s algorithm. While our use of priority queues does not improve the worst-case complexity, it appears to lead to an efﬁcient technique. In the majority of our tests Blossom V outperformed previous implementations of Cook and Rohe [8] and of Mehlhorn and Scha¨fer [24], sometimes by an order of magnitude. We also show that for large VLSI instances it is beneﬁcial to update duals by solving a linear program, contrary to a conjecture by Cook and Rohe.},

	title = {Optimization {Approaches} for the {Traveling} {Salesman} {Problem} with {Drone}},
	abstract = {The fast and cost-eﬃcient home delivery of goods ordered online is logistically challenging. Many companies are looking for new ways to cross the last-mile to their customers. One technology-enabled opportunity that recently has received much attention is the use of a drone to support deliveries. An innovative last-mile delivery concept in which a truck collaborates with a drone to make deliveries gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that we call the TSP with drone. In this paper, we model this problem as an IP and develop several fast route ﬁrst-cluster second heuristics based on local search and dynamic programming. We prove worst-case approximation ratios for the heuristics and test their performance by comparing the solutions to the optimal solutions for small instances. In addition, we apply our heuristics to several artiﬁcial instances with diﬀerent characteristics and sizes. Our experiments show that substantial savings are possible with this concept in comparison to truck-only delivery.},
